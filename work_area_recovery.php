As individuals, we generally have a plan for alternate resources to be activated in the case of disruptions or excegencies such as …… Flat Tires, Rains, bad weather, etc. This is a smart business standard that prepares for a “what if” scenario.</li><br>
                                    <li class="text-justify">In a world where uncertainties abound, it is imperative for every business to have a business continuity plan ready. Heightened exposure to disruptive and catastrophic events in recent years coupled with increasing government and commercial interdependencies make disaster recovery and crisis management a critical business imperative.
